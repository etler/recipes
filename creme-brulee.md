# Creme Brulee

* 2 cups heavy cream or half and half, chilled
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise (sub 2 tsp extract)
* 6 egg yolks
* 4 tsp bakers or granulated sugar
* pinch table salt
* 4-6 ramekins
* 2 tea bags (optional)

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 325Â°F
1. Combine 1 cup cream, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into pan, submerge pod in cream, and bring mixture to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Take pan off heat and let steep 15 minutes to infuse flavors, add tea bags if using to add extra recipes
1. Stir in remaining cold cup cream into cream mixture to cool. Whisk yolks in large bowl. Slowly add cream mixture into yolks and whisk until loosened and combined. Strain through fine-mesh strainer into pitcher or bowl, discard solids in strainer. Ladle mixture into ramekins and tap ramekins on counter to set
1. Place baking dish with ramekins on oven rack, pour boiling water into dish, until water reaches 1/2 height of ramekins. Bake until centers of custards are just barely set and are no longer sloshy and digital instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 170 to 175 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes. Begin checking temperature about 5 minutes before recommended time
1. Transfer ramekins to wire rack, cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Set ramekins on rimmed baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 4 days
1. Uncover ramekins, soak up any condensation with paper towel. Sprinkle each with about 1 teaspoon bakers or granulated sugar; tilt and tap ramekin for even coverage. Ignite torch and caramelize sugar. Refrigerate uncovered up to 30 to 45 minutes to re-chill
