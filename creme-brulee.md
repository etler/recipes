# Creme Brulee

* 2 cups heavy cream or half and half, chilled
* 1/3 cup granulated sugar
* 1 vanilla bean, halved lengthwise (sub 2 tsp extract)
* 6 egg yolks
* 4 tsp turbinado sugar or Demerara sugar
* pinch table salt
* 4-6 ramekins

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 300°F
1. Combine 1 cup cream, sugar, and salt in medium saucepan. Scrape seeds from vanilla bean into pan, submerge pod in cream, and bring mixture to boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to ensure that sugar dissolves. Take pan off heat and let steep 15 minutes to infuse flavors
1. Place kitchen towel in bottom of large baking dish or roasting pan and arrange four 4-5 oz ramekins on towel. Prepare hot water
1. Stir in remaining cold cup cream into cream mixture to cool. Whisk yolks in large bowl. Whisk cream mixture into yolks 1/2 cup at a time until loosened and combined. Strain through fine-mesh strainer into pitcher or bowl, discard solids in strainer. Pour or ladle mixture into ramekins
1. Place baking dish with ramekins on oven rack, pour boiling water into dish, until water reaches 1/2 height of ramekins. Bake until centers of custards are just barely set and are no longer sloshy and digital instant-read thermometer inserted in centers registers 170 to 175 degrees, 30 to 35 minutes. Begin checking temperature about 5 minutes before recommended time
1. Transfer ramekins to wire rack, cool to room temperature, about 2 hours. Set ramekins on rimmed baking sheet, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours or up to 4 days
1. Uncover ramekins, soak up any condensation with paper towel. Sprinkle each with about 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar; tilt and tap ramekin for even coverage. Ignite torch and caramelize sugar. Refrigerate uncovered up to 30 to 45 minutes to re-chill
