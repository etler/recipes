# M&M Cookies

serves: 18-24 cookies, depending on size

* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* ½ cup white sugar
* 1 cup clarified butter or shortening or 1/2 cup butter 1/2 cup shortening mix
* 2 eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2½ cups flour (+ 2-3 tablespoons)
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1½ cups M&M's

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, mix the brown sugar, white sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla with electric mixers on low speed until well mixed.
1. Add the 2½ cups flour, baking soda, and salt. Mix until just combined. Finished by hand if needed. Add the extra tablespoons of flour until the dough feels thick and almost dry to the touch. Stir the M&M's into the dough.
1. (optional) chill dough in fridge 30 minutes for fluffier cookies
1. Roll into balls and press extra M&M's into the tops. Flatten slightly with your palm or the back of a wooden spoon. Bake for 8-10 minutes (they will look slightly underbaked, do not brown). Remove from cookie sheet right away and place on cooling rack. Let stand for 5-10 minutes to help the cookies hold their shape.
