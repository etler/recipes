# Cacio e Pepe

* 4 oz tagliolini or spaghetti
* 1 cup Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, finely grated
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* salt
* 3/4 cups pasta water reserved
* 3/4 cup Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, grated (optional)

1. Boil pasta in well-salted water and strain about three minutes before it's fully cooked, reserve 3/4 cups of the pasta water
1. Add fresh cracked pepper, then butter, then reserved pasta water to a large saucepan
1. Cook the pasta in the sauce until it's al dente and has absorbed most of the liquid
1. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in cheese a little bit at a time, reserving some for topping later
1. (Optional) Make a crispy cheese bowl. Spread 3/4 cup cheese in a thin layer on the bottom of a non-stick saucepan and cook for three minutes, or until it becomes pliable. Remove the cheese sheet from the pan with a spatula and use a ramekin or small bowl to mold it.
1. Top with more cheese.
