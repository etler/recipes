* 4 oz tagliolini or spaghetti
* 1 oz Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, finely grated
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp Tellicherry black pepper, whole
* salt
* 3/4 cups pasta water, reserved (plus extra if needed)
* 3/4 oz Parmesan or Pecorino Romano, grated (optional for cheese bowl)

1. Boil pasta in well salted water and strain about three minutes before it's fully cooked. Reserve 3/4 cups of pasta water plus extra
1. While pasta is cooking, toast whole black pepper in large dry saucepan on medium heat until fragrant. Grind toasted pepper into pan, add butter, then 3/4 cups pasta water
1. Cook the pasta in the sauce until it is al dente and has absorbed most of the liquid
1. Remove the pan from heat and stir in cheese a little bit at a time. Add additional pasta water if necessary
1. (Optional) Make a crispy cheese bowl. Spread 3/4 cup cheese in a thin layer on the bottom of a non-stick saucepan and cook for three minutes, or until it becomes pliable. Remove the cheese sheet from the pan with a spatula and use a ramekin or small bowl to mold it.
