* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2 tsp sweet paprika
* 1 tsp mustard powder
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder

* 2 cups tomato sauce
* 3/4 cup light brown sugar

1. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant (2-3 minutes)
1. Stir in paprika and mustard. Add vinegar and Bourbon. Bring to a bare simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes.
1. Stir in remaining ingredients, add salt and pepper. Increase heat to high and bring to the boil, then reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered, stirring to prevent scorching until sauce reduces and thickens slightly (40-45 minutes).
