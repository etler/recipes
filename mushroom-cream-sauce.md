# Mushroom Cream Sauce

* 1 lb mushrooms, sliced thin or 6 portobello mushrooms gills removed
* olive oil
* 2 tsp black pepper
* 4 tbsp butter
* 3 cloves garlic, chopped coarsely
* 1 shallot, chopped finely
* 1/4 cup Cognac, brandy, cooking wine, or whiskey
* 3/4 cup heavy cream or half and half
* 1 tbsp dijon mustard
* salt

1. Brush mushrooms with olive oil. Cook 10-15 minutes. (If portobello, sprinkle pepper evenly over gill side. Heat pan over medium high heat, add mushrooms gill side up, sear until underside is browned and the gill side looks wet, 3-6 minutes. Flip and cook 2-4 minutes.)
1. Reduce to medium low heat. Add the butter and garlic, and season with salt. (If portobello, flip mushrooms so they're gill side up, tilt the skillet to spoon up the melting butter and baste the mushrooms until tender, 2-5 minutes.)
1. Transfer mushrooms to a plate, leaving the butter in the skillet.
1. Add the shallot and stir until softened, 2-4 minutes, add more butter if the pan is dry. Carefully add the alcohol. Stir until nearly evaporated. Add heavy cream and mustard, season with salt, and stir to combine. Return the mushrooms to the pan (if portobello gill side down), and cook until the cream is thickened and the color of a latte, 2-4 minutes.
