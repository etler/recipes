# Pumpkin Pie

* 2 cups canned pumpkin
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 3 large eggs, lightly beaten
* 2 tbsp pure cane syrup
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup light brown sugar
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp ground ginger
* 1 [pie crust](./pie-crust)

1. Preheat oven to 350°F
1. Whisk together all ingredients in a large bowl. Pour into cooled crust. Bake until filling is firm around edges but still jiggles slightly in center, 45-50 minutes. If needed, cover edges with foil after 35 minutes to prevent overbrowning
1. Cool completely, about 3 hours. Filling will continue to firm up as it cools
1. Decorate with cutouts
